The function array is off by one on each iteration.
When the previous loop ends, the next one loops n iterations too early.
The first loop is correct, but the next one starts 1 iteration too early.
The second loop is 2 loops ... etc.

This has been resolved.

Next issue is local operators using the array.

The correct syntax is for example:

np.all([function_list[0][0]==[0,0,0,0]])

Note the double list and the double equals.
