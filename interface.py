# DONE! Create a function that iterates over the dimensions of the coordinate array.
# At each call to create a function, the current coordinates of each coordinate array should be submitted.
# Then, one large table can be created. I.E.:
# [[(0, 0), (0, 0), (0, 0)], [function coeffs]]
# ... and so on.
