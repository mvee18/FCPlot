# FCPlot - Force Constant Plot

<b> Welcome to FC Plot! </b>

This program's purpose is to take the force constants / derivatives used by the program spectro, then to plot them as a
typical potential curve, which would allow us to extract the energies from the force constants without having to store them.

Its initial implementation will be written in Python, then ported over to Go.
